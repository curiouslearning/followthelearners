        h2.is-size-2 Are the street views exactly where the learners are located? What about learner privacy?
        h5.is-size-5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All learner information is anonymized and no personally identifiable information is collected from the learner.
        h5.is-size-5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The street views, powered by Google Maps, shown in Follow The Learners™ are meant as a representation of the region that learner is from for the donor to be able to see a general approximation of what it might be like to live in that region.
        h5.is-size-5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any buildings, businesses, homes, schools, daycare centers, etc. present in the street views do not imply any affiliation or endorsement of Follow The Learners™ or Curious Learning.

        h2.is-size-2 What about reaching children that do not have access to a smartphone?
        h5.is-size-5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With as much as 50% of homes having a smart phone in parts of the world where only 12% of the population can read at grade level, the most cost effective thing we can do is reach those devices. 
        h5.is-size-5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of the rapid growing base of smartphones, we are also testing ways of getting devices preloaded with apps in the hands of those that would otherwise not have access. If you are interested in learning more or supporting these types of pilots please

        h2.is-size-2#how-do-children-learn-from-the-apps How do children learn from the apps?
        h5.is-size-5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learning to read demands many hours of practice and support for a child’s individual learning journey. The apps allow them to practice literacy skills at their level and for as long as they need. Children learn to read by receiving instruction in the relationship between sounds and the letters that represent those sounds. This instruction is most effective when it builds on what children already know about a language- words and meanings, how to make sentences, stories and real world knowledge. They use the apps to first understand and then practice their sounds and letters which they can use to begin to read simple words. Simple stories allow a child to begin reading stories on their own and receive immediate feedback so they can always increase their skills. The apps support every child’s need to achieve mastery in all of the areas of word knowledge that support reading and understanding text.
